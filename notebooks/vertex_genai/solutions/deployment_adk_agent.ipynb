    "**Agent Engine** is a set of services that enables developers to deploy, manage, and scale AI Agents in production. It handles the infrastructure to scale agents in production so you can focus on creating applications. Agent Engine integrates closely with the Python SDK for the Gemini model in Vertex AI, and it can manage prompts, agents, and examples in a modular way. Also its compatible with ADK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, or other Python frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the services that Agent Engine offers, which you can use individually or in combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime:** Deploy and scale agents with a managed runtime and end-to-end management capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality and evaluation**: Evaluate agent quality with the integrated Gen AI Evaluation service and optimize agents with Gemini model training runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Store**: Store and dynamically retrieve few-shot examples to improve agent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sessions**: Agent Engine Sessions lets you store individual interactions between users and agents, providing definitive sources for conversation context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Bank**: Agent Engine Memory Bank lets you store and retrieve information from sessions to personalize agent interactions."

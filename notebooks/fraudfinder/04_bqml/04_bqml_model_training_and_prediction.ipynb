Because of this, if the data you use to train on doesn't yet have the up-to-date information about whether it's truly fraud or not, you may end up training an ML model on incorrect data (i.e. on transactions that are actually fraud, but were labeled as not-fraud at the time of training). If this is the case, then when you choose what data you use for training a model, be sure you use the point-in-time by \"time-traveling\" an appropriate number of days into the past to a date when you're confident that the labels should be accurate when fetching feature values from Vertex AI Feature Store.

    "### Computation Based Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "[Computation based metrics](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/determine-eval#computation-based-metrics) are computed using mathematical formulas to compare the model's output against a **ground truth or reference**. Commonly used computation-based metrics include ROUGE and BLEU. The commonly used metrics can be categorized into the following groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexicon-based metrics: Use math to calculate the string similarities between LLM-generated results and ground truth, such as `Exact Match` and `ROUGE`.\n",
    "- Count-based metrics: Aggregate the number of rows that hit or miss certain ground-truth labels, such as `F1-score`, `Accuracy`, and `Tool Name Match`.\n",
    "- Embedding-based metrics: Calculate the distance between the LLM-generated results and ground truth in the embedding space, reflecting their level of similarity. These include `cosine similarity` and `euclidean distance` \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we are trying to evaluate how well different prompts works for summarization using Gemini. We'll start by defining a few articles in `context` and since we are using computation based metrics for evaluation, we will also need to define the ground truth for the summaries. This will be defined in `reference`. `eval_dataset` should be a dataframe that contains columns needed for evaluation.\n",

    "The EvalTask class is a core component of the Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK framework. It allows you to define and run evaluation jobs against your Gen AI models/applications, providing a structured way to measure their performance on specific tasks. Think of an EvalTask as a blueprint for your evaluation process. Evaluation tasks must contain an evaluation dataset, and a list of metrics to evaluate. Supported metrics are documented on the Generative AI on Vertex AI [Define your evaluation metrics page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/determine-eval). The dataset can be an `pandas.DataFrame`, Python dictionary or a file path URI and can contain default column names such as `prompt`, `reference`, `response`, and `baseline_model_response`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bring-your-own-response (BYOR): You already have the data that you want to evaluate stored in the dataset. You can customize the response column names for both your model and the baseline model using parameters like response_column_name and baseline_model_response_column_name or through the metric_column_mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform model inference without a prompt template: You have a dataset containing the input prompts to the model and want to perform model inference before evaluation. A column named prompt is required in the evaluation dataset and is used directly as input to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform model inference with a prompt template: You have a dataset containing the input variables to the prompt template and want to assemble the prompts for model inference. Evaluation dataset must contain column names corresponding to the variable names in the prompt template. For example, if prompt template is \"Instruction: {instruction}, context: {context}\", the dataset must contain instruction and context columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "EvalTask supports extensive evaluation scenarios including BYOR, model inference with Gemini models, 3P models endpoints/SDK clients, or custom model generation functions, using computation-based metrics, model-based pointwise and pairwise metrics. The evaluate() method triggers the evaluation process, optionally taking a model, prompt template, experiment logging configuartions, and other evaluation run configurations. You can view the SDK reference documentation for [Gen AI Evaluation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reference/python/latest/vertexai.evaluation) package for more details.\n",

While the water is heating up, cook pancetta or guanciale in a skillet with olive oil over medium heat until it's crispy and golden brown. Once the pancetta is done, remove it from the skillet and set it aside. In the same skillet, whisk together eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper to make the sauce. When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain it and immediately toss it in the skillet with the egg mixture, adding a splash of the pasta cooking water to create a creamy sauce.\",\n",

Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic to the pot, and cook until they're soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Next, add Arborio rice to the pot and cook, stirring constantly, until the grains are coated with the butter and begin to toast slightly. Pour in a splash of white wine and cook until it's absorbed. From there, gradually add hot chicken or vegetable broth to the rice, stirring frequently, until the risotto is creamy and the rice is tender with a slight bite.\",\n",

Season the steak generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides, pressing the seasoning into the meat. Preheat a grill to high heat and brush the grates with oil to prevent sticking. Place the seasoned steak on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time to your desired level of doneness. Let the steak rest for a few minutes before slicing against the grain and serving.\",\n",

    "Let us conclude by noting that a Vertex tuning job collects and reports model tuning and model evaluation metrics, which can then be visualized in Vertex AI Studio by clicking on your tuned model name in the tuning section of Vertex AI Studio.\n",
    "Here is a description of the metrics that are computed:\n",

    "#### Model tuning metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The model tuning job automatically collects the following tuning metrics for `gemini-1.0-pro-002`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/train_total_loss`: Loss for the tuning dataset at a training step.\n",
    "* `/train_fraction_of_correct_next_step_preds`: The token accuracy at a training step. A single prediction consists of a sequence of tokens. This metric measures the accuracy of the predicted tokens when compared to the ground truth in the tuning dataset.\n",
    "* `/train_num_predictions`: Number of predicted tokens at a training step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model validation metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure a model tuning job to collect the following validation metrics for gemini-1.0-pro-002 by passing an evaluation dataset as we did in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "`/eval_total_loss`: Loss for the validation dataset at a validation step.\n",
    "`/eval_fraction_of_correct_next_step_preds`: The token accuracy at an validation step. A single prediction consists of a sequence of tokens. This metric measures the accuracy of the predicted tokens when compared to the ground truth in the validation dataset.\n",
    "`/eval_num_predictions`: Number of predicted tokens at a validation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics visualizations are available after the model tuning job completes. \n",
    "If you don't specify a validation dataset when you create the tuning job, \n",
    "only the visualizations for the tuning metrics are available.\n",

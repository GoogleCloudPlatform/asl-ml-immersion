    "In this notebook, we implement a simple (albeit fast and scalable) [semantic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search#:~:text=Semantic%20search%20seeks%20to%20improve,to%20generate%20more%20relevant%20results.) retrieval system using [Vertex Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview) and [Vertex PaLM Embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings). In a semantic search system, a number of documents are returned to a user query, ranked by their semantic match. This means that the returned documents should match the intent or meaning of the query rather than its actual exact  keywords as opposed to a boolean or keyword-based retrieval system. Such a semantic search system has in general two components, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A component that produces semantically meaningful vector representations of both the documents as well as the user queries; we will use the [Vertex PaLM Embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) API to creates these embeddings, leveraging the power of the [PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html) large language model developed at Google. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A component that allows users to store the document vector embeddings and retrieve the most relevant documents by returning the documents whose embeddings are the closest to the user-query embedding in the embedding space. We will use [Vertex Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview) which can scale up to billions of embeddings thanks to an [efficient approximate nearest neighbor strategy](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-scann-efficient-vector.html) to compare and retrieve the closest document vectors to a query vector based on a [recent paper from Google research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10396).\n",

    "](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge), which contains around 1 million of medical research papers focused on COVID 19. We will focus on only 4000 titles, abstracts, and urls from 2021 only for the sake of speed.\n"

We choose here the `COSINE_DISTANCE` which essentially is a measure of the angle between the embedding vectors. Other possible choices are the square of the euclidean distance (`SQUARED_L2_DISTANCE`), the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) (`L1_DISTANCE`), or the dot product distance (`DOT_PRODUCT_DISTANCE`). (Note that if the embeddings you are using have been trained to minimize the one of these distances between matching pairs, then you may get better results by selecting this particular distance, otherwise the `COSINE_DISTANCE` will do just fine.) \n",

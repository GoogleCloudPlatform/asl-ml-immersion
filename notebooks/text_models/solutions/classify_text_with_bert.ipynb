    "\n",
    "[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and other Transformer encoder architectures have been wildly successful on a variety of tasks in NLP (natural language processing). They compute vector-space representations of natural language that are suitable for use in deep learning models. The BERT family of models uses the Transformer encoder architecture to process each token of input text in the full context of all tokens before and after, hence the name: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. \n",

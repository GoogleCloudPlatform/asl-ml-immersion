We need to set the `Training budget` which is the maximum number of node hours to spend training our model. Thankfully, if improvement stops before that, then the training will stop (if the `Enable early stopping` toggle is on) and you'll only be charged for the actual node hours you used. For this dataset, I got decent results with a budget of just 1 node hour. Once that is set the click the `START TRAINING` button."

To make these easy, we can for now just predict on the BigQuery table that we used to train and evaluate on. To do that, select the tab `BATCH PREDICTIONS`, click `CREATE BATCH PREDICTION`, give any `Batch prediction name`. Select the radio button `BigQuery table` and then enter your `BigQuery Project Id`, `BigQuery Dataset Id`, and `BigQuery Table or View Id`. We could have also used CSVs from Google Cloud Storage. Then we need to select where we want to put our Result. Let's select the Output format `BigQuery` and then enter our `Google Cloud project ID`.

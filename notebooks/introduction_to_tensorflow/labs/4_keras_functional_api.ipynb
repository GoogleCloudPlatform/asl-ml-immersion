    "  1. Understand embeddings and how to create them with the preprocessing layer\n",
    "  1. Understand Deep and Wide models and when to use them\n",
    "  1. Understand the Keras functional API and how to build a deep and wide model with it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, we learned about the Keras Sequential API. The [Keras Functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras#functional_api) provides an alternate way of building models which is more flexible. With the Functional API, we can build models with more complex topologies, multiple input or output layers, shared layers or non-sequential data flows (e.g. residual layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll use what we learned about preprocessing layers to build a Wide & Deep model. Recall, that the idea behind Wide & Deep models is to join the two methods of learning through memorization and generalization by making a wide linear model and a deep learning model to accommodate both. You can have a look at the original research paper here: [Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792).\n",

    "<sup>(image: https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wide part of the model is associated with the memory element. In this case, we train a linear model with a wide set of crossed features and learn the correlation of this related data with the assigned label. The Deep part of the model is associated with the generalization element where we use embedding vectors for features. The best embeddings are then learned through the training process. While both of these methods can work well alone, Wide & Deep models excel by combining these techniques together. "

    "BigQuery is more than just a data warehouse, it also has some ML capabilities baked into it. \n",

    "As of January 2019 it is limited to linear models, but what it gives up in complexity, it gains in ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "BQML is a great option when a linear model will suffice, or when you want a quick benchmark to beat, but for more complex models such as neural networks you will need to pull the data out of BigQuery and into an ML Framework like TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a naive model using BQML. **This notebook is intended to inspire usage of BQML, we will not focus on model performance.**"

There are many more options [we could specify](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#model_option_list), such as regularization and learning rate, but we'll accept the defaults.\n",

    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of BQML is its ease of use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We created a model with just two additional lines of SQL\n",
    "- We never had to move our data out of BigQuery\n",
    "- We didn't need to use an ML Framework or code, just SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "There's lots of work going on behind the scenes make this look easy. For example BQML is automatically creating a training/evaluation split, tuning our learning rate,  and one-hot encoding features if neccesary. When we move to TensorFlow these are all things we'll need to do ourselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was just to inspire usagage of BQML, the current model is actually very poor. We'll prove this in the next lesson by beating it with a simple heuristic. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could improve our model considerably with some feature engineering but we'll save that for a future lesson. Also there are additional BQML functions such as `ML.WEIGHTS` and `ML.EVALUATE` that we haven't even explored. If you're interested in learning more about BQML I encourage you to [read the offical docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigqueryml).\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on out we'll focus on pulling data out of BigQuery and building models using TensorFlow, which is more effort but also offers much more flexibility."

    "\n",
    "- Build a first simple RNN model in Keras/TensorFlow for Question-Answering \n",
    "- Build and improve a Multi-Layer Bidirectional RNN in Keras/TensorFlow\n",
    "- Evaluate the results on a test set\n",
    "- Try out our model several questions in the test/validation sets\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a **Multi-Layer Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to perform Question-Answering tasks over a Corpus of Documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question-Answering** consists in extracting precise and concise information (in the form of a short phrase or span of words) from a group of documents in order to answer a question. It involves a combination of **Document Retrieval** and **Natural Language Processing** techniques:\n",
    "- **Step1:** Given the question, we retrieve the *k* most relevant documents from our Corpus. \n",
    "- **Step2:** We run a text comprehension model (our RNN) over the retrieved documents to extract the most satisfying answer in the form of a concise span of words. *This notebook will focus on this step.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind Question-Answering is to refuse to stop after Step1: **instead of letting the user go through all *k* documents and read through long paragraphs of text to find their answer, the model keeps going and finds it for them.**\n",

    "Above, we only use 1000 rows of test data because we are using a very small virtual VM. But when this first Model - when trained on 70,000+ datapoints - obtains an **Exact Match Score of 11.0%, and a F1 Score of 23.8%** on the Test set. This is not ideal yet... Below are a few ideas on how we could improve from there - by adding complexity while making sure we keep the regularization in check!\n",

    "We can improve the model in different ways:\n",
    "* **Adding features to each *pi***:\n",
    "    * **Binary Feature**: takes the value 1 if *pi* matches any one of the words in ***q***, 0 otherwise. An additional step would be to compare lemmas.\n",
    "    * **POS and NER Features**: to reflect some properties of each *pi* in its context, e.g its part-of-speech (POS) and named entity recognition (NER) tags - for example using <a href=\"https://spacy.io/models\" target=\"_blank\">Spacy</a> and the \"doc.to_array\" method.\n",
    "* **Adding Layers**: The main reason for stacking layers is to allow for greater model complexity - which is exactly what we're looking for here!  \n",
    "* **Bi-directionality**: A key idea of RNNs is to take in a sequence from left (past) to right (future) and preserve information from one word to the next. Conceptually, this implies each word is treated in the context of the words that came before it. But context is not unidirectional: using bi-directionality will allow the model to run from left to right and from right to left: it will preserve information from both past and future, and will be able to treat a word in its *full* context. You can read more about it and how it's implemented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.  \n",
    "* **Dropout**: Dropout consists in \"dropping out\" neurons at random to force the model to rely on a wider range of features and avoid over-fitting. Concretely, it will choose to ignore neurons with a pre-defined probability in each forward/backward pass of the training phase. At test time however, Dropout will be turned off and all neurons will be able to play their parts. It is a powerful method for regularizing Neural Networks, and was first introduced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_(neural_networks)\" target=\"_blank\">by Geoffrey Hinton, et al. in 2012</a>. A solid review of Dropout as applied to RNNs can be found <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bingobee01/a-review-of-dropout-as-applied-to-rnns-72e79ecd5b7b\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n"

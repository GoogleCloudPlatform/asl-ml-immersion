    "While the prompt design is excellent for quick experimentation, if training data is available, you can achieve higher quality by tuning the model. Tuning a model enables you to customize the model response based on examples of the task you want the model to perform.\n",

If you want to run more concurrent jobs you need to request additional quota via the [Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).\n",

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to evaluate your model to understand its performance. Evaluation can be done in an automated way using evaluation metrics like F1, Bleu, or Rouge. You can also leverage human evaluation methods. Human evaluation methods involve asking humans to rate the quality of the LLM's answers. This can be done through crowdsourcing or by having experts evaluate the responses. Some standard human evaluation metrics include fluency, coherence, relevance, and informativeness. Often you want to choose a mix of evaluation metrics to get a good understanding of your model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other metrics we will compute the following two metrics that provide crude measures albeit automated of how two texts may have the same meaning: \n",
    "- [Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU): The BLEU evaluation metric is a measure of the similarity between a machine-generated text and a human-written reference text.\n",
    "- [Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)): The ROUGE evaluation metric is a measure of the overlap between a machine-generated text and a human-written reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use  [sequence-evaluate](https://pypi.org/project/sequence-evaluate/) to to compute the scores.\n",
    "Earlier in the notebook, you created a train and eval dataset. Now it's time to take some of the eval data. You will use the questions to get a response from our tuned model, and the answers we will use as a reference:\n",
    "- **Candidates**: Answers generated by the tuned model.\n",

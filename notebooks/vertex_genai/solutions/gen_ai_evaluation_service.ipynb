    "Vertex AI's Gen AI evaluation service empowers you to assess any generative AI model or application according to your specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying solely on general leaderboards and reports, you can define your own evaluation criteria and directly compare how different models perform against your unique needs, use case and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This service allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain a deeper understanding of model performance. And, Go beyond general metrics and understand how a model handles your specific data and tasks.\n",
    "- Make informed decisions throughout the development lifecycle. By using evaluations to guide model selection, refine prompt engineering, and optimize model customization.\n",
    "- Streamline your evaluation workflow by leveraging Vertex AI's integrated tools to easily launch and reuse evaluations as needed.\n",

In a separate bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\",\n",

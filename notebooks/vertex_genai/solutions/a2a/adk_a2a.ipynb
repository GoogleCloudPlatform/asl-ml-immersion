    "Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol is designed to standardize communication between AI agents, particularly for those which are deployed in external systems. Previously, such protocols were established for Tools called Model Context Protocol (MCP) which is an emerging standard to connect LLMs with data and resources. A2A tries to complement MCP where A2A is focused on a different problem, while MCP focuses on lowering complexity to connect agents with tools and data, A2A focuses on how to enable agents to collaborate in their natural modalities. It allows agents to communicate as agents (or as users) instead of as tools; for example, enable back-and-forth communication when you want to order something.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2A is positioned to complement MCP, in the official documentation it is recommended that applications use MCP for tools and A2A for agents - represented by AgentCard ( We will discuss this later on ). The frameworks can then use A2A to communicate with their user, the remote agents, and other agents.\n"

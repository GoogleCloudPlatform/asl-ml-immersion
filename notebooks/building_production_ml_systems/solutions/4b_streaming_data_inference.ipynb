    "# Working with Streaming Data\n",

    "Learning Objectives\n",
    " 1. Learn how to process real-time data for ML models using Cloud Dataflow\n",
    " 2. Learn how to serve online predictions using real-time data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful to leverage real time data in a machine learning model when making a prediction. However, doing so requires setting up a streaming data pipeline which can be non-trivial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically you will have the following:\n",
    " - A series of IoT devices generating and sending data from the field in real-time (in our case these are the taxis)\n",
    " - A messaging bus to that receives and temporarily stores the IoT data (in our case this is Cloud Pub/Sub)\n",
    " - A streaming processing service that subscribes to the messaging bus, windows the messages and performs data transformations on each window (in our case this is Cloud Dataflow)\n",
    " - A persistent store to keep the processed data (in our case this is BigQuery)\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps happen continuously and in real-time, and are illustrated by the blue arrows in the diagram below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this streaming data pipeline is established, we need to modify our model serving to leverage it. This simply means adding a call to the persistent store (BigQuery) to fetch the latest real-time data when a prediction request comes in. This flow is illustrated by the red arrows in the diagram below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../assets/taxi_streaming_data.png' width='80%'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will address how to process real-time data for machine learning models. We will use the same data as our previous 'taxifare' labs, but with the addition of `trips_last_5min` data as an additional feature. This is our proxy for real-time traffic.\n",

# CI/CD for a KFP pipeline

In this lab you will walk through authoring of a **Cloud Build** CI/CD workflow that automatically builds and deploys a KFP pipeline. You will also integrate your workflow with **GitHub** by setting up a trigger that starts the  workflow when a new tag is applied to the **GitHub** repo hosting the pipeline's code.

## Lab instructions

The lab instructions are in the `lab-03.ipynb` notebook.

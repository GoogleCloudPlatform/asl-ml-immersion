    "\n",
    "[FraudFinder](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/fraudfinder) is a series of labs on how to build a real-time fraud detection system on Google Cloud. Throughout the FraudFinder labs, you will learn how to read historical bank transaction data stored in data warehouse, read from a live stream of new transactions, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature engineering, ingest features into a feature store, train a model using feature store, register your model in a model registry, evaluate your model, deploy your model to an endpoint, do real-time inference on your model with feature store, and monitor your model."

    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "As you engineer features for model training, it's important to consider how the features are computed when making predictions with new data. For online predictions, you may have features that can be pre-computed via _batch feature engineering_. You may also features that need to be computed on-the-fly via _streaming-based feature engineering_. For these Fraudfinder labs, for computing features based on the last n _days_, you will use _batch_ feature engineering in BigQuery; for computing features based on the last n _minutes_, you will use _streaming-based_ feature engineering using Dataflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate very recent customer and terminal activity (i.e. within the last hour), computation has to be done on real-time streaming data, rather than via batch-based feature engineering. This notebook shows a step-by-step guide to create real-time data pipelines to build features. You will learn to:\n",

    "- Create features, using window and aggreation functions in an Apache Beam pipeline\n",
    "- Deploy the Apache Beam pipeline to Dataflow\n",
    "- Ingest engineered features from Dataflow into Vertex AI Feature Store\n",

    "This lab uses the following Google Cloud services and resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\n",
    "- [DataFlow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/)\n",

    "- calculate terminal activity features (last 15-mins, 30-mins, and 60-mins)\n",
    "\n",

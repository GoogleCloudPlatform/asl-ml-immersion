    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through building a question/answer system that retrieves information to formulate responses, effectively grounding the LLM with specific information. A pre-trained LLM, or likely even a fine-tuned LLM will not be sufficient (in and of itself) when you want a system that understands specific, possibly private data or information that was not in its training dataset.\n",

    "### Simplify and Scale with LangChain and Chroma\n",
    "Of course with only 5 examples of grounding information, we could easily include all five in a prompt. In other words, the extra retrieval step to identify *what* is needed in the prompt was unnessesary. Of course in the real world we may have thousands or millions of grounding information examples. Additionally as the number of grounding examples grows, simply computing a distance for every single vector is incredibly innefficient. In other words, production retrieval augmented generation systems require:\n",
    "* Scalable vector databases to store large amounts of information\n",
    "* Efficient ways of performing nearest neighbor searches \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are many options for a vectorstore, including managed and scalable offerings like [Vertex AI Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview). For simplicity, in this lab we will use [Chroma](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma) as a vectorstore and [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) to orchestrate the retrieval system. Langchain will provide classes and methods that help simplify the steps we had to implement ourselves in the toy example above.   "

LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs are artificial neural networks typically built with a transformer-based architecture. Some recent implementations are based on alternative architectures such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word. Up to 2020, fine tuning was the only way a model could be adapted to be able to accomplish specific tasks.

They are thought to acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics and \"ontology\" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.Some notable LLMs are OpenAI\\'s GPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT), Google\\'s PaLM and Gemini (used in Bard), Meta\\'s LLaMA family of open-source models, and Anthropic\\'s Claude models.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers presented their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\", which, with the goal of improving upon 2014 Seq2seq technology, introduced the transformer architecture, based mainly on the attention mechanism, developed by Bahdanau et. al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced, which quickly became \"ubiquitous\".Although GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and \"completely changed the world\". The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4.\\nIn the meantime, competing language models have for the most part been playing catch-up to the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters. Notable exceptions in terms of number of parameters included Google\\'s 2019 T5-11B and 2022 PaLM-E.\\nSince 2022, open source models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though the latter is restricted to only noncommercial uses. Mistral AI\\'s models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. As of January 2024, Mixtral 8x7b is the most powerful open source LLM according to the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, being more powerful than GPT-3.5 but not as powerful as GPT-4.\\n\\n\\n== Dataset preprocessing ==\\n\\n\\n=== Probabilistic tokenization ===\\nUsing a modification of byte-pair encoding, in the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram repeatedly until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). Token vocabulary consists of integers, spanning from zero up to the size of the token vocabulary. New words can always be interpreted as combinations of the tokens and the initial-set uni-grams.A token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word.

    "Now that we have the documents we will split them into chunks. Each chunk will become one vector in the vector store. To do this we will define a chunk size (number of characters) and a chunk overlap (amount of overlap i.e. sliding window). The perfect chunk size can be difficult to determine. Too large of a chunk size leads to too much information per chunk (individual chunks not specific enough), however too small of a chunk size leads to not enough information per chunk. In both cases, nearest neighbors lookup with a query/question embedding may struggle to retrieve the actually relevant chunks, or fail altogether if the chunks are too large to use as context with an LLM query.\n",

In addition to `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, there are [other text splitters](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) you can consider."

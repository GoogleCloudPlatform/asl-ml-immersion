    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of labs are updated upon [FraudFinder](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/fraudfinder) repository which builds a end-to-end real-time fraud detection system on Google Cloud. Throughout the FraudFinder labs, you will learn how to read historical bank transaction data stored in data warehouse, read from a live stream of new transactions, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature engineering, ingest features into a feature store, train a model using feature store, register your model in a model registry, evaluate your model, deploy your model to an endpoint, do real-time inference on your model with feature store, and monitor your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on deploying our trained fraud detection model as a real-time inference service. We'll be using a serverless architecture, which allows us to build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. This means we can focus on our code and let Google Cloud handle the scaling, availability, and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our architecture will be event-driven, leveraging Pub/Sub to trigger our inference service in response to new transaction events. This is a common pattern for real-time systems, as it allows for loose coupling between components and can handle high volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will create a Cloud Run app to perform model inference on the endpoint deployed in the previous notebooks. This Cloud Run app will be triggered by a Pub/Sub subscriber for live transactions, perform a look-up on feature values from the Vertex AI Feature Store, and send the prediction request to the Vertex AI endpoint. You can then view the resulting prediction-response logs in BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab uses the following Google Cloud services and resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/)**: For hosting our trained model on an endpoint and for using the Feature Store to retrieve feature values for inference.\n",
    "- **[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)**: For storing and analyzing the prediction logs from our model.\n",
    "- **[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)**: A serverless compute platform that will host our inference application. It automatically scales up and down, and you only pay for the resources you use.\n",
    "- **[Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)**: A real-time messaging service that will be used to trigger our Cloud Run application whenever a new transaction occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps we will take in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Build and deploy a Cloud Run app for model inference**: We'll containerize our inference code using Docker and deploy it to Cloud Run.\n",
    "2.  **Create and use a Pub/Sub push subscription to invoke the Cloud Run model inference app**: We'll set up a trigger so that our Cloud Run service is called for each new transaction."

    "## Build and deploy a Cloud Run app for model inference\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize the process of prediction, you will use a Cloud Run app that takes in live transactions as a trigger, then fetches feature values from Vertex AI Feature Store, then sends the prediction payload to an endpoint. To clarify, to invoke the Cloud Run app, you will create a Pub/Sub push subscription that reads live transactions from the public Pub/Sub topic to invoke the Cloud Run app.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a serverless compute platform that enables you to deploy containers that can be executed every time it is triggered. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cloud Run Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build and deploy our application, let's take a closer look at the code that will be running on Cloud Run. The application is a simple Flask web server that receives Pub/Sub messages, processes them, and sends a prediction request to our Vertex AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application code is located in the `notebooks/fraudfinder/scripts/cloud_run_model_inference/` directory and consists of three main files:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   [`main.py`](./scripts/cloud_run_model_inference/main.py): This is the main application file. It contains a Flask web server with a single endpoint that listens for POST requests. When a request is received, the application:\n",
    "    1.  Parses the incoming Pub/Sub message to extract the transaction data.\n",
    "    2.  Retrieves additional features from the Vertex AI Feature Store.\n",
    "    3.  Constructs a prediction request with the combined features.\n",
    "    4.  Sends the request to the Vertex AI Endpoint.\n",
    "    5.  Logs the prediction result.\n",
    "*   `Dockerfile`: This file defines the container image for our application. It specifies the base Python image, copies the application code, installs the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and defines the command to start the Flask web server using `gunicorn`.\n",
    "*   `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies that our application needs to run, including `Flask`, `gunicorn`, and the `google-cloud-aiplatform` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "By containerizing our application, we can ensure that it runs consistently across different environments and can be easily deployed to Cloud Run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to build and deploy the Cloud Run app\n",

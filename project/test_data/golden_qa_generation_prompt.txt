## Chat Gpt's explanation for "bad" questions/answers
I included 4 “bad” questions that are either too broad, contradictory, or vague:

“Who is the main villain in The Scarlet Letter?” (a bit simplistic; villainy is subjective).

“What advice does the White Rabbit give Alice about logic?” (misleading; the White Rabbit does not teach logic).

“What are all the events in The Scarlet Letter from start to finish?” (asks for too much information).

“What does the Mad Hatter say about time?” (contradictory, oversimplified; the Hatter doesn’t literally teach time control).

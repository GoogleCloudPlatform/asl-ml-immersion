    "## Advanced Agent: Research and Report Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore a more complex agent setup involving a team of specialized agents working together to accomplish a multi-step task: researching a topic and generating a report. This approach is inspired by patterns of agentic collaboration and iterative refinement, similar to concepts seen in frameworks like LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To build an orchestrator agent that manages a team of sub-agents to:\n",
    "1.  **Plan:** Create an outline for a report on a given topic.\n",
    "2.  **Search:** Gather information using a (mocked) Google Search tool based on the plan.\n",
    "3.  **Write:** Draft the report using the plan and gathered research.\n",
    "4.  **Critique:** Review the drafted report and provide feedback."

    "### Agent Team Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research and report generation system will consist of the following agents, all residing in the `adk_agents/agent4_research_agent/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`ResearchOrchestratorAgent` (`agent.py`)**: The main agent that manages the overall workflow. It receives the initial topic and delegates tasks to the appropriate sub-agents in sequence.\n",
    "*   **`PlannerAgent` (`planner_agent.py`)**: Takes the topic from the orchestrator and generates a structured outline for the report.\n",
    "*   **`SearchAgent` (`search_agent.py`)**: Receives the plan (or specific queries derived from it) and uses the `google_search` tool to find relevant information. For this demonstration, the `google_search` tool is mocked and returns predefined results for specific queries (see `tools.py`).\n",
    "*   **`WriterAgent` (`writer_agent.py`)**: Uses the plan created by the `PlannerAgent` and the information gathered by the `SearchAgent` to write a first draft of the report.\n",
    "*   **`CritiqueAgent` (`critique_agent.py`)**: Reviews the draft produced by the `WriterAgent` and provides constructive feedback, suggesting improvements or areas needing more work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delegation Flow & Session State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ResearchOrchestratorAgent` controls the process:\n",
    "1.  User provides a topic (e.g., \"The Impact of Renewable Energy on Climate Change\"), which the orchestrator stores in `session.state['current_topic']`.\n",
    "2.  It delegates to `PlannerAgent`. `PlannerAgent` reads `session.state['current_topic']` and its output (the essay plan) is conceptually placed by the orchestrator into `session.state['essay_plan']`.\n",
    "3.  It then delegates to `SearchAgent`. `SearchAgent` reads `session.state['essay_plan']` (or queries derived from it) and its findings are placed into `session.state['research_results']`.\n",
    "4.  Next, `WriterAgent` is invoked. It uses `session.state['essay_plan']` and `session.state['research_results']` to create a draft, which goes into `session.state['drafted_essay']`.\n",
    "5.  `CritiqueAgent` then reviews `session.state['drafted_essay']`, and its feedback is stored in `session.state['essay_critique']`.\n",
    "6.  Finally, the `ResearchOrchestratorAgent` is configured with an `output_key='final_report_and_critique'`. It will combine the `drafted_essay` and `essay_critique` (or a summary of the process) into this key in the session state as its final output for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow allows each agent to focus on its specific task, with the session state acting as the shared workspace for passing information between them."

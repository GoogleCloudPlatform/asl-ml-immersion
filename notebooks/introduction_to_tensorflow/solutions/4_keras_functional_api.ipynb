    "# Introducing the Keras Functional API and Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** This notebook assumes you have some familiarity with the Keras Sequential API, covered in previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "  1. Understand the Keras Functional API and its advantages for building flexible model architectures.\n",
    "  2. Learn how to implement Wide & Deep models, understanding the concepts of memorization (wide) and generalization (deep).\n",
    "  3. Utilize various Keras preprocessing layers for feature engineering (e.g., `Discretization`, `HashedCrossing`, `Embedding`).\n",
    "  4. Apply custom feature engineering transformations using Keras `Lambda` layers.\n",
    "  5. Build, train, and evaluate a model using the Functional API, incorporating engineered features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction: Beyond Sequential Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous notebooks, you've become acquainted with the Keras Sequential API, which is excellent for building models as a linear stack of layers. However, many real-world problems require more complex model architectures. This is where the [Keras Functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras#functional_api) shines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Functional API allows you to create a graph of layers, offering greater flexibility. With it, you can build models with:\n",
    "*   **Multiple input and output layers:** Imagine a model that takes both an image and text as input, or predicts multiple attributes simultaneously.\n",
    "*   **Shared layers:** Use the same layer multiple times in different parts of your model.\n",
    "*   **Non-sequential data flows:** Create architectures with branches, skip connections (like in ResNets), or other custom pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore these capabilities by first building a **Wide & Deep model**. This type of model combines the strengths of learning simple, direct rules (the \"wide\" part) with the ability to learn complex, abstract patterns (the \"deep\" part). We'll then enhance our model further by applying custom feature engineering techniques using `Lambda` layers, demonstrating another powerful aspect of the Functional API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Wide & Deep models with the Keras Functional API\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind **Wide & Deep models** is to combine the strengths of two distinct types of learning: **memorization** and **generalization**. You can explore the original research paper here: [Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792).\n",

    "<sup>(image: https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The \"Wide\" Component (Memorization):**\n",
    "    *   This part of the model is typically a linear model. It excels at *memorizing* direct interactions between features and the target variable. \n",
    "    *   Think of it as learning simple, explicit rules from the data. For example, \"if a user frequently buys product A and product B together, they are likely to click on an ad for product C.\"\n",
    "    *   It often uses features like cross-product transformations (e.g., `pickup_location` AND `dropoff_location`) to learn these specific rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The \"Deep\" Component (Generalization):**\n",
    "    *   This part is a deep neural network (DNN).\n",
    "    *   It's good at *generalizing* by learning complex, abstract patterns in the data through multiple layers of non-linear transformations. \n",
    "    *   It often uses embedding layers to represent categorical features in a dense, lower-dimensional space, allowing the model to discover nuanced relationships. For example, it might learn that certain types of pickup locations (e.g., airports, business districts) have similar fare characteristics, even if the specific locations themselves are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why combine them?**\n",
    "By joining these two components, a Wide & Deep model can leverage the strengths of both. The wide part quickly learns simple rules, while the deep part captures more complex patterns that the wide part might miss. This often leads to better performance on tasks where both types of learning are valuable, such as recommendation systems, search ranking, and classification problems with diverse features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll construct both the wide and deep sections using Keras preprocessing layers and then combine them using the Functional API to predict taxi fare amounts."

    "    *   `.shuffle(buffer_size=1000)` (if `mode == \"train\"`): Randomly shuffles the data to ensure that the model doesn't learn from the order of examples. `buffer_size` determines how many elements are buffered for shuffling.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have our input layers, we'll define the preprocessing steps. This is where the Functional API's flexibility starts to become evident. We can create different processing pipelines for different inputs or different model paths (wide vs. deep).\n",

    "*   `dnn_hidden_units = [32, 8]`: Defines the number of neurons in the hidden layers of our deep path.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Bucketization with `Discretization` Layer:**\n",
    "    *   Continuous features like latitude and longitude are often more powerful when transformed into categorical features. Bucketization (or binning) achieves this.\n",
    "    *   `np.linspace(...)`: We first define the boundaries for these buckets. For example, `latbuckets` will be a list of 16 evenly spaced latitude values.\n",
    "    *   `Discretization(lonbuckets, name=\"plon_bkt\")(inputs[\"pickup_longitude\"])`:\n",
    "        *   This layer takes the raw `pickup_longitude` input and assigns each value to one of the `lonbuckets`.\n",
    "        *   The output `plon` (pickup longitude bucketized) will be an integer representing the bucket index.\n",
    "    *   We do this for pickup/dropoff latitudes and longitudes, creating `plon`, `plat`, `dlon`, `dlat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Feature Crossing with `HashedCrossing` Layer:**\n",
    "    *   Feature crossing combines two or more categorical features into a new feature that represents their joint interaction. This is a key technique for the \"wide\" part of the model, helping it memorize specific combinations.\n",
    "    *   `HashedCrossing(num_bins=(NBUCKETS + 1) ** 2, name=\"p_fc\")((plon, plat))`:\n",
    "        *   This layer takes the bucketized pickup longitude (`plon`) and latitude (`plat`) and creates a new crossed feature `p_fc` (pickup feature cross).\n",
    "        *   `num_bins`: The number of hash bins for the output. A common practice is to set this to roughly the product of the number of categories of the input features. Since each discretized feature has `NBUCKETS` categories, `(NBUCKETS + 1)**2` provides a reasonable hash space (the +1 accounts for potential out-of-vocabulary values, though `Discretization` handles this by assigning to boundary buckets).\n",
    "    *   We create three crossed features:\n",
    "        *   `p_fc`: Crossing pickup longitude and latitude.\n",
    "        *   `d_fc`: Crossing dropoff longitude and latitude.\n",
    "        *   `pd_fc`: Crossing `p_fc` and `d_fc` (a higher-order cross representing the interaction between pickup area and dropoff area).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we chain operations: the output of one layer (e.g., `inputs[\"pickup_longitude\"]`) becomes the input to the next (e.g., `Discretization(...)`). This is the essence of the Functional API – building a graph of computations."

    "#### Define Evaluation Metric, Instantiate and Compile the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can train our model, we need a few more things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Custom RMSE Metric (`rmse` function):**\n",
    "    *   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a common metric for regression problems. It measures the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. This penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n",
    "    *   Keras allows custom metrics. Our `rmse` function calculates this: `tf.keras.ops.square(y_pred[:, 0] - y_true)` computes the squared error, `tf.keras.ops.mean(...)` averages it, and `tf.keras.ops.sqrt(...)` takes the square root.\n",
    "    *   `y_pred[:, 0]` is used because our model outputs a tensor of shape `(batch_size, 1)`, and we need to compare it with `y_true` which is typically `(batch_size,)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Instantiate the Model (`keras.Model`):**\n",
    "    *   `model = Model(inputs=list(inputs.values()), outputs=output)`\n",
    "    *   This is where we officially define our Keras model using the Functional API.\n",
    "    *   `inputs`: We provide a list of all the input layers we defined earlier (obtained from `list(inputs.values())`).\n",
    "    *   `outputs`: We specify the final output tensor of our model, which is `output` (the `Dense` layer we defined in the previous step).\n",
    "    *   Keras automatically traces the graph of layers from the inputs to the outputs to create the complete model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Compile the Model (`model.compile`):**\n",
    "    *   `model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\", loss=\"mse\", metrics=[rmse], run_eagerly=True)`\n",
    "    *   `optimizer=\"adam\"`: Adam is a widely used and generally effective optimization algorithm.\n",
    "    *   `loss=\"mse\"`: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is chosen as the loss function. The model will try to minimize this value during training. For regression, MSE is a standard choice.\n",
    "    *   `metrics=[rmse]`: We include our custom RMSE metric to monitor during training and evaluation.\n",
    "    *   `run_eagerly=True`: This is often useful for debugging, as it runs the model step-by-step, making it easier to trace errors. For production or performance-critical training, you'd typically set this to `False` (which is the default) to leverage TensorFlow's graph execution capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Visualize the Model (`tf.keras.utils.plot_model`):**\n",
    "    *   `tf.keras.utils.plot_model(model, show_shapes=False, rankdir=\"LR\")`\n",
    "    *   This utility is incredibly helpful for visualizing the architecture of your Functional API model. It generates an image of the layer graph.\n",
    "    *   `show_shapes=False`: Hides the input/output shapes of each layer in the plot for a cleaner look. Set to `True` if you want to see them.\n",
    "    *   `rankdir=\"LR\"`: Renders the graph from Left to Right, which is often intuitive for model architectures.\n",
    "    *   Take a moment to examine the generated plot. You should be able to trace the wide and deep paths, the preprocessing steps, and how they combine. This visual confirmation is a great way to ensure your model is connected as intended."

    "Neural networks often perform better when input numerical features are on a similar scale. **Normalization** scales features to have zero mean and unit variance (or to a specific range like [0,1]). This can help with faster convergence during training and prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.\n",

    "\n",
    "2.  **Instantiate and Adapt Normalization Layers:**\n",
    "    *   `lat_scaler = keras.layers.Normalization(axis=None)`: We create a `Normalization` layer for latitude. `axis=None` means the normalization will be computed across all values provided.\n",
    "    *   `lon_scaler = keras.layers.Normalization(axis=None)`: Similarly, for longitude.\n",
    "    *   `lat_scaler.adapt(lat_values)`: This is the crucial step. The `adapt()` method takes the `lat_values` (a NumPy array of all latitude values from the training set) and computes the mean and variance. These statistics are then stored within the `lat_scaler` layer.\n",

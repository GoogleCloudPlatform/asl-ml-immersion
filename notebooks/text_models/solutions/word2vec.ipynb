    "Word2Vec is not a singular algorithm, rather, it is a family of model architectures and optimizations that can be used to learn word embeddings from large datasets. Embeddings learned through Word2Vec have proven to be successful on a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks.\n",

    "Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf). It is not an exact implementation of the papers. Rather, it is intended to illustrate the key ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "These papers proposed two methods for learning representations of words: \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Continuous Bag-of-Words Model** which predicts the middle word based on surrounding context words. The context consists of a few words before and after the current (middle) word. This architecture is called a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the context is not important.\n",
    "*   **Continuous Skip-gram Model** which predict words within a certain range before and after the current word in the same sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use the skip-gram approach in this notebook. First, you'll explore skip-grams and other concepts using a single sentence for illustration. Next, you'll train your own Word2Vec model on a small dataset. This notebook also contains code to export the trained embeddings and visualize them in the [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org/).\n"

    "While a bag-of-words model predicts a word given the neighboring context, a skip-gram model predicts the context (or neighbors) of a word, given the word itself. The model is trained on skip-grams, which are n-grams that allow tokens to be skipped (see the diagram below for an example). The context of a word can be represented through a set of skip-gram pairs of `(target_word, context_word)` where `context_word` appears in the neighboring context of `target_word`. "
